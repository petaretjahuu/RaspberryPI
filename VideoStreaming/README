Script that facilitates the utilization of the Raspberry Pi camera for seamless video streaming. This script leverages the capabilities of Buster, which significantly simplifies the camera setup process.

The Python code, originally crafted by Random Nerd Tutorials, serves as the foundation. The code is accessible via the following link: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/video-streaming-with-raspberry-pi-camera/

In addition to the provided code, I have enhanced the functionality by automating the installation of prerequisite Python modules, streamlining the setup procedure.

To initiate the installation process, execute the following commands in terminal:
curl -o installation.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petaretjahuu/RaspberryPI/main/VideoStreaming/installation.sh
chmod +x installation.sh
sh ./installation.sh
curl -o rpi_camera_surveillance_system.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petaretjahuu/RaspberryPI/main/VideoStreaming/rpi_camera_surveillance_system.py

Alternatively, following single-line command can be used for a more expedited setup:
curl -o installation.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petaretjahuu/RaspberryPI/main/VideoStreaming/installation.sh && chmod +x installation.sh && sh ./installation.sh && curl -o rpi_camera_surveillance_system.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petaretjahuu/RaspberryPI/main/VideoStreaming/rpi_camera_surveillance_system.py

Once the setup is complete, video streaming is started by executing the command below in terminal:
python3 rpi_camera_surveillance_system.py
